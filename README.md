# TradingView Connect

This is a work in progress, a minimum viable product is expected to be completed by December 2020.

The idea is to have a running AWS (Amazon EC2) server that gets real time TradingView alerts from algorithms, strategies, or indicators and then execute a trade based on that alert on a broker (yet to be known which). It would use HTTP POST and GET requests.

The program would ideally be customized with the investor's choice of lot size, take profit, stop loss, and / or trailing stop.
